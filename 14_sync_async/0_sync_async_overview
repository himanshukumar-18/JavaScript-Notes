>> Synchronous : It's mean run all the codes one by one, after complete previous code next code will be execute

>> Asynchronous : It's mean run all the codes together, which code complete first, this code will be execute first





>> In default JavaScript is a Synchronous or Single Thrated Language.
    ** its mean it work one by one given by the order.


>> Execution Context
    ** Execute one line of code at a time

    example : (each line of code wait for the print last one, after that next line will be execute)
                console.log("one")  // Print first
                console.log("two")  // after print one this line will execute



>> Blocking code (Synchronous)
    ** Block the flow of programme

>> Non Blocking Code (Asynchronous)
    ** do not block execution
